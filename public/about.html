My name is Keddrick Varnado and I am a brand-new web developer based in Tucson, Arizona. After over a decade in the restaurant industry, I decided I
 wanted to challenge myself in a new industry and learn a new set of skills that I could build on. After tossing a few industries back and forth, I discovered the
 world of web development and jumped right in! I am very excited to learn these skills push myself to become a great developer, and see what awesome things I can make.
